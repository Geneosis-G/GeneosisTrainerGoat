[b]EASTER EGGS[/b]
- [spoiler]Bigger Goatymons have more health, smaller Goatymons attack faster.[/spoiler]
- [spoiler]Combine this mod with Ghost Goat and you can take the form of any animal in the game ^^[/spoiler]
- [spoiler]There is a secret console command that will turn the last creature that entered a Goatyball into a Goatymon. Anyway Goatymons made using that command won't be saved, so you can't transport them to other maps.[/spoiler]

[b]KNOWN BUGS[/b]
- When you capture a Goatymon the game can randomly crash. If you are lucky the Goatymon should be saved anyway. (can't fix)
- The Alien model is glitchy. (can't fix)
- Some Goatymons (Horse/Donkey/Pig) will fly really far away if you knock them. (can't fix)

[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]It'as aliiiive! I think I will stop trying to find which mod took the longest time to make, but this one took a bloody long time for sure >_< Anyway the Payday update added a very long delay in the middle of the development of this mod...
Anyway here we go, the [strike]Pokémon[/strike] Goatymon mod is now real :D First things first: the Goatyballs. So those are made by combining a few spherical and cylindric objects in the game, and some appropriate textures ^^ Their ability to "contain" stuff is based on a hidden inventory that will store the items until you want them back.
Then came the Goatymons ^^ This is the part that took most of the time to set up, because it includes a new NPC type (one that can take the form of every single animal in the game) and a new AI. That AI is probably the most complex I have done so far as it combines everything the other AIs I made can do: random walk, follow goat or other NPC, turn by turn battle mode and several attacks :)
I could have added a lot more stuff like more attacks, leveling, more battle modes, etc... But as I wanted to publish this mod as soon as possible (and not in 2 or 3 years) I decided to stop there :p
